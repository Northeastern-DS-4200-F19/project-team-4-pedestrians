      <h1>Project Team #4: Pedestrian, DS 4200 F19</h1>

      <p><strong>David Viviano</strong>, <strong>Zerun Tian</strong>, <strong>Nikita Goyal</strong>, <strong>Kabir Dugal</strong></p>

      <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/ds4200-f19/">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cody.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Prof. Cody Dunne</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>


      <h1>Motivation</h1>

      <p><em>Summary of user needs and motivating questions.</em></p>

      <p><em>Carol Blair has asked us to create a visualization that is focused on the pedestrians. She has noticed that pedestrians have opted to use the pathways that are closest to the main road, as opposed to the pathways that go through the park, due to reasons such as convenience, safety, etc. We were asked to create a visualization that emphasized this problem. We anticipate that the primary user of our visualization will be the Chester Square Neighborhood Association members.  We also want it to be an entry point for more professional users, such as policy makers. Our visualization should be simple enough to gain local support but advanced enough to justify professional interest.</em></p>

      <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

      <p><em>final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

      <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
      <p><em> We worked with 2 data sets to create the above visualizations - data from observations of pedestrians in Chester Square Park, and data from a survey sent to residents of the neighborhood. Our first data set is observation data that was collected by watching and recording the start locations, end locations, and the chosen path of pedestrians on-site.  This data is meant to provide information on the travel tendencies of everyday commuters. Our second data set comes from a survey that we sent to the Chester Square Neighborhood Association, from which we received 14 responses. These results provide pathway preferences of residents under different circumstances.</em></p>

      <p><em>Our observation data contains the numbers 1-6, which corresponds to values on our map visualization. ‘Path Taken’ represents the pathway that the pedestrian took.  The encoding, A-H, corresponds to the paths labeled on our map vis.  The ‘To Destination’ column stores the values ‘N’ and ‘S’.  ‘N’ means the pedestrian was travelling towards Northeastern, while ‘S’ means the pedestrian travelled towards Boston Medical Center.  Finally, we recorded the date/time we collected data in the final column.
        For our survey data, each row represents a residents responses. The survey questions are the column headers: we kept track of what side of Massachusetts Avenue they live on, which paths they take in rush/non-rush situations, and which paths they would prefer to take in rush/non-rush situations.</em></p>

      <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

      <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

      <p><em>The above parallel coordinates visualization should be able to answer the following tasks: “Which pedestrian paths are used most and least?” and “Why does a pedestrian use a Chester Square sidewalk?”. It was created from survey data, highlighting resident’s preferences for paths in the neighborhood under different time constraints. When selecting a particular response/resident, that resident’s preferred paths will be highlighted in the parallel coordinates chart. In the map next to this, those paths will be highlighted, making it possible for the viewer to understand which paths are preferred while the resident is in a rush versus not in a rush, as well as most and least preferred path. The congestion of that path will be encoded in terms of line thickness, showing which routes are more popular using data from our data collection dataset. This is encoded in a map as to make it clear which path the pedestrian chose - if it is a more direct route or not. This visualization will highlight the reasons people use different paths as well as the overall most popular paths for residents and non-residents alike, in an attempt to more fully understand the pedestrian dynamic of Chester Square.</em></p>

      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
      Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
      Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>

      <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
